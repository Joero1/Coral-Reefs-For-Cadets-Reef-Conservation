       REEF &nbspCONSERVATION</h1></div>
  
  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">It is important to tackle coral reef degradation from a number of angles.</p>

  <br>

<div style="border: solid 2px gray; padding: 0px 35px 10px 35px;">
<h2>The Political Approach</h2>

  <img align="right" style="padding-left: 60px; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px;" height="120" width="190" src="https://blog.technavio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/solar-energy-companies.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Reducing carbon emission and switching to alternative energy</strong><br>
The UN has set a target to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius by 2100.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Reduce Plastic Production</strong><br>
The recycling target for plastic packaging is now 55% with only 10% ending up in landfill by 2030 (Circular Economy Action Package).</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Sustainable Fishing</strong><br>
All around the world, there is evidence that correctly managed fisheries result in huge recoveries of fish populations. About 1 quarter of coral reefs are now marine protected areas. However, this still needs to increase, and so does regulation.</p>

<img align="right" style="padding-left: 60px; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px;" height="120" width="190" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b4/78/c4/b478c4f35d7a235a2d1b6b5338a65649.jpg">
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Alternative Income Opportunities</strong><br>
Encouraging workers to halt labor that is environmentally destructive is both unlikely and problematic if there is not alternative forms of income on offer. Seaweed farming is a growing industry that is non-destructive to the marine environment and provides food and other useful resources and alterative jobs for fishermen.</p>
  
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Increase funding of conservation efforts</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Increased education of the public</strong></p>

<h2>The Biological Approach</h2>

<img align="right" style="padding-left: 60px; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 20px;" height="200" width="300" src="https://www.outdoorjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2_160728_2823_brettmonroegarner.jpg">
<p><strong>Improved Monitoring</strong><br>
Conservationists have finite power and resources and therefore typically have to pick their battles. Because of this, a lot of ecological research focuses on identifying which species are A) experiencing the biggest declines and B) which species are most influential on the wider ecosystem.</p>
  
<p><strong>Coral Restoration</strong><br>
Restoration in the form of coral propagation consists of rearing corals in controlled conditions and then planting them onto the reef. It is a practice that is now very common all over the tropics and subtropics. The aim is to maximize the survivorship and productivity of the reared corals. The planted corals are still prone to the environmental stressors such as climate change. However, what coral propagation does is allow reared corals to grow in optimal conditions providing them with a competitive advantage over other less beneficial organisms (e.g. algae). It can also increase the chance of cross-fertilization by exposing genetically diverse coral colonies to one another.</p>

  <img align="left" style="padding-left: 0px; padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 60px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="https://blog.nature.org/science/files/2013/06/NCM101122_D101.jpg" height="120" width="170">
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">There are two types of coral restoration. In ‘asexual propagation’, fragments of coral are extracted to become new colonies grown in optimum conditions. In ‘sexual propagation’ coral gametes (sperm and egg cells) are collected and fertilized and reared in laboratory conditions and then moved onto the reef when they are ready.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">During asexual propagation, when corals are in their rearing stage, they grow on a coral ‘nursery’. These nurseries come in a number of forms. They may be suspended midwater, or be fixed on the sea floor. Once they are big enough, they are transferred to the reef and fixed in suitable locations where they will in time fuse with the rest of the reef.</p>
  
<p><strong>Culling Invasive Species</strong><br>
The Caribbean suffers from substantial damage from invasive lionfish. Lionfish spearing is an activity that is widely encouraged to keep their numbers on these reefs as low as possible. Culling them in this way is very effective for the areas where it takes place. However if culling in the area ceases, lionfish make fast recoveries. It therefore needs to be carried out routinely to be effective.</p>
<img src="https://lionfish-hunting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Swimming-with-spears-and-container-picmonkeyed.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  
<p>In the Great Barrier Reef, population booms of crown of thorns starfish also need to be dealt with by culling. However, unlike lionfish in the Caribbean, simply spearing them doesn’t help, because as a stress response, these starfish often release thousands of juveniles into the water when threatened! The starfish therefore need to be injected with lethal chemicals by trained professionals.</p>
<img src="https://www.nps.gov/articles/images/national_park_service_diver_and_crown_of_thorns.jpeg" height="120" width="170">
  
<p>For both lionfish and crown of thorns starfish, and for any other ecologically problematic marine species, do not partake in culling activities without the required training. There are legal requirements and risks associated with exposure to venom, causing accidental damage to the reef, misidentifying species, killing them in regions where they should NOT be culled and more.</p>

<h2>The Domestic Approach</h2>
<p>There are six main areas of your life where YOU can make a significant positive impact on the reef….</p>

<p><strong>1) Home Care</strong><br>
Aim to reduce your energy consumption. This will reduce your carbon footprint and therefore global warming and by extension rising ocean temperatures, coral bleaching and much more. Reduce, reuse and recycle as much as possible to reduce household waste to keep litter out of the sea.</p>
  
<p><strong>2) Be a Responsible Consumer</strong><br>
Products are made because you buy them. Aim to reduce use of plastic and harmful chemicals. Only buy seafood if it has been sustainably caught. Reduce meat and dairy consumption is one of the most effective ways to reduce your carbon footprint.</p>

<p><strong>3) Support Marine Conservation Programs</strong><br>
There are plenty of ways to get involved in activities orchestrated by marine conservation organizations. Familiarise with them and get to know them. Beach clean ups are a highly rewarding activity that everyone can do to help keep waste out of the sea. Most conservation organizations are only possible because of your funding. Many people desire to get hands on involved in helping the reef. But it is important to remember that one of the most beneficial things you can do for the reef is donate. Someone may stay away from the sea all their life and have a job that has nothing to do with conservation and still be one of the greatest saviours of the reef if they are willing to generously redirect much of their income towards reef protection agendas.</p>

<p><strong>4)Be a responsible tourist</strong><br>
A lot of tourist activities take quite a toll on greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution. However there are ways to offset this. Support ecotourism organizations. Respect local guidelines. Clean up after yourself and don’t take from nature.</p>

<p><strong>5) Political Pressure</strong><br>
In democracies, politicians push for agendas that they think will get them elected. This is why your voice truly matters to them. The more the public voice marine conservation as something that should be prioritised, the more politicians will consider it a priority. Incentives for politicians will be largely economic. There are no shortage of economic reasons to protect coral reefs as they generate an estimated $30 billion every year for the global economy.</p>

<p><strong>6) Educate Yourself and Others</strong><br>
The more you know, the more you will understand what the best actions are to take to help the reef. Help others understand the importance of protecting the reef. The reef needs as many people as possible in all demographics and from all political backgrounds doing their bit in all these areas. It is not something that should be polarized. It is about protecting an absolutely fundamental phenomenon to Planet Earth that is of socioeconomic necessity and supports an unparalleled array of wildlife.</p>
